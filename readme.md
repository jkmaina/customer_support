## Chapter 19 Project: Customer Support AI Agent

This repository contains the complete code for the customer support AI agent discussed in Chapter 19. The project demonstrates Test-Driven Development (TDD) in building AI applications.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand TDD in AI applications
- Build modular AI agents with LangChain and LangGraph
- Write and maintain test suites for AI components
- Manage state in conversational AI

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python and testing
- OpenAI API key
- The Complete LangGraph Blueprint book (recommended)

### Project Structure

```

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository and create a virtual environment:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd customer_support
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your OpenAI API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

4. Run the tests:
```bash
pytest
```

### Key Components

1. **Intent Classification** (Chapter 19.5)
   - Located in `src/support_agent.py`
   - Classifies customer queries into specific intents
   - Handles order status, product inquiries, and general chat

2. **State Management** (Chapter 19.4)
   - Located in `src/conversation_memory.py`
   - Manages conversation history and context
   - Implements turn counting and message tracking

3. **Entity Extraction** (Chapter 19.5)
   - Located in `src/llm_classifier.py`
   - Processes product names, colors, and other entities
   - Includes product catalog functionality

4. **Main Agent Workflow** (Chapter 19.3)
   - Implements complete customer support workflow
   - Uses LangGraph for state management
   - Demonstrates proper error handling

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_support_agent.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **API Key Errors**
   - Verify OpenAI API key in `.env`
   - Check python-dotenv configuration

2. **Test Failures**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Verify internet access for API calls
   - Check OpenAI model availability

3. **State Management Issues**
   - Verify state dictionary keys
   - Check message history maintenance

### Next Steps

1. Read Chapter 20 for advanced agent patterns
2. Try the exercises at the end of Chapter 19
3. Implement additional features suggested in the book:
   - New intents
   - Extended product catalog
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Conversation summarization
   - User authentication
